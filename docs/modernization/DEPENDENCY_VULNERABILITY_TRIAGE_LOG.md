# Dependency Vulnerability Triage Log

This log tracks triage decisions for dependency findings produced by OWASP Dependency-Check.

## Policy
- `OPEN`: finding confirmed and pending remediation.
- `ACCEPTED_RISK`: deferred with explicit risk owner and expiry.
- `FALSE_POSITIVE`: confirmed false positive; corresponding suppression required.
- `MITIGATED`: fixed and verified.

Rules:
- Every `FALSE_POSITIVE` entry must reference a suppression rule in `/Users/karloknezevic/Desktop/Ferko/build-tools/dependency-check/suppressions.xml`.
- Every `ACCEPTED_RISK` must include an expiry date and owner.
- No anonymous entries.

## Current Status (2026-02-19)
- Authoritative CVE baseline is blocked until `NVD_API_KEY` is configured in CI secrets.
- CI now publishes:
  - `dependency-check-report.json/html`
  - `triage-summary.md`

## Entries

| Date | ID | Dependency | Severity | Status | Decision/Reason | Owner | Expiry | Ticket |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-02-19 | N/A | N/A | N/A | OPEN | Configure `NVD_API_KEY` to produce authoritative scan data | Platform | 2026-03-05 | TBD |

## Triage Workflow
1. Download CI artifact `dependency-check-report`.
2. Review `triage-summary.md` and full JSON report.
3. Add/update entries in this log.
4. If false positive, add narrow suppression in `build-tools/dependency-check/suppressions.xml`.
5. Re-run scan and verify finding disposition.
